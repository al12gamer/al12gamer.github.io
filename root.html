<h3>What is this and Why should I?</h3>
<p>While this video by Marques Brownlee was originally uploaded in 2012, the meaning of rooting is still the same.</p>

<h3>Rooting Methods Differ</h3>
<p>Again, depending on your phone the methods will differ. Three popular phones are listed below but you can get more root guides from the famed developers on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA-Developers</a> and other sites. Most of the popular root methods, custom firmwares and apps are on that site however.</p>

<p>Xposed will be linked and given screenshots of in a future update...</p>
<h2>Custom Roms</h2>
<p>Custom "Roms" are known as entire zipped-up, flashable, distributions of the Android operating system. One of the most popular of these is Cyanogenmod. This will be touched upon in future updates...</p>
